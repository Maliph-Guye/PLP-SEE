🧮 Simple Calculator
This is a basic web-based calculator application that performs standard arithmetic operations. It's built as a learning project to demonstrate fundamental web development concepts.

✨ Features
Basic Arithmetic Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Clear Functionality: Easily clear the current input or the entire calculation.

Responsive Design: Works well on different screen sizes (though this is a simple version, responsiveness is a core principle).

🚀 How to Use
Clone the repository: (If this were a GitHub project)

git clone https://github.com/Maliph-Guye/PLP-SEE.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd simple-calculator

Open index.html: Simply open the index.html file in your web browser.

Alternatively, you can just paste the HTML code into a live editor or a local .html file and open it.

🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML5: For the structure of the calculator.

CSS3: For styling and layout.

JavaScript: For the calculator's logic and interactivity.

🔮 Future Enhancements
Add more advanced mathematical functions (e.g., square root, power, percentage).

Implement keyboard support for input.

Improve error handling (e.g., division by zero).

Add a history of calculations.
